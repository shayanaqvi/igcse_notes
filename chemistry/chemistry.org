* Redox reactions
** Oxidation
Oxidation is,
1. the gain of oxygen during a chemical reaction
2. an increase in oxidation state
3. the loss of hydrogen during a chemical reaction
4. the loss of electrons during a chemical reaction
*** Examples
- \(S(s) + O_2(g) --> SO_2(g)\) (sulfur has been oxidised to sulfur dioxide)
- \(H_2S(g) + Cl_2 --> S(s) + 2HCl(g)\) (hydrogen sulfide has lost hydrogen and has oxidised to sulfur)
- \(Mg --> Mg^{2+} + 2e^-\) (magnesium has lost electrons and has been oxidised)
*** Oxidation state
Oxidation state refers to the hypothetical charge an element/atom would have if it was an ion in a compound.
**** Determining an oxidation state
| Rule                                                                                                  | Example(s)                                                                          | Oxidation state                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| The oxidation state of an element (on its own) is zero.                                               | \(Cu\)                                                                              | 0                                                      |
| The oxidation state of a simple ion is the same as its charge.                                        | \(Li^+, O^{-2}\)                                                                    | \(Li^+=+1\), \(O^{2-}=-2\)                             |
| Some elements have a fixed oxidation state in their compounds.                                        | Elements from group 1, group 2, hydrogen in most compounds, oxygen i most compounds | group 1 = +1, group 2 = +2, hydrogen = +1, oxygen = -2 |
| The oxidation states of the elements/atoms in a compounds sum to zero.                                | \(MgO --> +2 + (-2) = 0\), \(K_2O --> 2(+1) + (-2) = 0\)                            | 0 for both examples                                    |
| The sum of oxidation states of a polyatomic ion (e.g., \(OH^-\)) is the same as the charge on the ion | \(OH^- --> -2 + 1 = -1\)                                                            | -1                                                     |
** Reduction
Reduction is,
1. the loss of oxygen during a chemical reaction
2. a decrease in oxidation state
3. the gain of hydrogen during a chemical reaction
4. the gain of electrons during a chemical reaction
*** Examples
- \(2Al(s) + 3CuO(s) --> Al_2O_3(s) + 3Cu(l)\) (copper oxide has been reduced to copper)
- \(H_2(g) + Cl_2(g) --> S(s) + 2HCl(g)\) (chlorine has gained hydrogen and has thereby been reduced to hydrochloric acid)
- \(Cl_2 + 2e^- --> 2Cl^-\) (chlorine has gained electrons and has been reduced)
** Identifying a redox reaction
*** Redox in terms of gain/loss of oxygen
If an element/atom is oxidised or reduced, the reaction is redox. For e.g.,
- \(Zn(s)+CuO(s) --> ZnO(s) + Cu(s)\)
Here, zinc is oxidised (becomes \(ZnO\)), and copper is reduced (becomes \(Cu\)).
*** Redox in terms of gain/loss of electrons
If an element/atom gains or loses electrons, the reaction is redox. For e.g.,
- \(Zn(s)+Cu^{2+}(s) --> Zn^{2+}(s)+Cu(s)\)
Here, zinc gains electrons (goes from \(Zn\) to \(Zn^{2+}\)) and is therefore oxidised, while copper loses electrons (goes from \(Cu^{2+}\) to \(Cu\)) and is therby reduced.
*** Redox in terms of changes in oxidation states
If the oxidation state of an element/atom increases or decreases, the reaction is redox. For e.g.,
| \(Zn(s)\) | + | \(CuO(s)\) | --> | \(ZnO(s)\) | + | \(Cu(s)\) |
|         0 |   |         +2 |     |         +2 |   |         0 |
Here, the oxidation state of zinc goes from 0 to +2, meaning it has been oxidised. The oxidation state of copper goes from +2 to 0, meaning it has been reduced.
** Agents
If a substance is oxidised, any substance that is reduced is its oxidising agent. If a substance is reduced, any substance that is oxidised is its reducing agent.
*** Oxidising agent
An oxidising agent is a substance that causes another substance to oxidise.
**** Identifiying an oxidising agent
Consider the following reaction:
- \(Cl_2(g) + H_2S(g) --> 2HCl(g) + S(s)\)
Here, sulfur has lost hydrogen and has therefore been oxidised. In this case, the oxidising agent would be \(Cl_2\).
*** Reducing agent
A reducing agent is a substance that causes another substance to reduce.
**** Identifying a reducing agent
Consider the following reaction:
- \(Cl_2(g) + H_2S(g) --> 2HCl(g) + S(s)\)
Here, chlorine has gained hydrogen and has therefore been reduced to hydrochloric acid. Therefore, the reducing agent would be \(H_2S(g)\).
*** Identification/tests
**** Identification of oxidising agents
\(KI(aq)\) or starch-iodide paper can be used to test the presence of an oxidising agent. \(\KI\)
| Test                                                       | Observation                                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add \(KI(aq)\) to the unkown solution                      | A brown solution is formed                       | Iodide ions are oxidised to iodine through the oxidising agent in the solution (\(2I^-(aq) --> I_2(aq) + 2e^-\))                             |
| Dip a piece of starch-iodide paper in the unknown solution | The starch-iodide paper turns from white to blue | Iodide ions are oxidised to iodine through the oxidising agent, which subsequently reacts with the starch in the paper to form a blue colour |

*** Classification of hydrocarbons
There are two categories of hydrocarbons:
1. Saturated hydrocarbons
   - Belongs to the 'Alkane' homologous series  ([[Alkane homologous series]])
2. Unsaturated hydrocarbons
   - Belongs to the 'Alkene' homologous series ([[Alkene homologous series]])
*** Differences between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons
|                         | Homologous Series | General Formula | Bond  |
|-------------------------+-------------------+-----------------+-------|
| Saturated hydrocarbon   | Alkane            | $C_nH_{2n+2}$   | C - C |
| Unsaturated hydrocarbon | Alkene            | $C_nH_{2n}$     | C = C |
** Homologous series
The homologous series is a family of organic compounds with the same functional group and similar chemical properties. Organic compounds in the same homologous series have the following characteristics:
- They have the same functional group
- They have similar chemical properties
- There is a gradual change in their physical properties the further down the series, due to a change in the size of the atoms.
*** Alkane homologous series
*General formula*: $C_nH_{2n+2}$
| Name    | Molecular Formula |
|---------+-------------------|
| Methane | $CH_4$            |
| Ethane  | $C_2H_6$          |
| Propane | $C_3H_8$          |
| Butane  | $C_4H_{10}$       |
| ...     | ...               |
**** Molecular structure of Alkanes
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, meaning there are only single carbon-carbon bonds (C-C).
**** Physical properties of Alkanes
a) Melting/boiling point
   - Generally low melting and boiling points.
   - The melting point increases down the group due to an increase in the number of bonds between the molecules (more heat is needed to overcome more bonds).
b) Flammability
   - The flammability of Alkanes decreases down the group due to an increase in the size of molecules. Larger molecules are harder to burn and therefore ouput less flame.
c) Viscosity
   - The viscosity (thickness/difficulty of flow) of Alkanes increases down the group due to an increase in the size of molecules. The state of Alkanes gradually changes from gaseous (first 4) to liquid to solid.
**** Chemical properties of Alkanes
a) Reactivity
   - Alkanes are unreactive hydrocarbons.
   - Are insoluble in water.
   - Are soluble in organic solvents.
b) Combustion
   - This refers to the burning of an Alkane in the presence/with a supply of oxygen.
     1. Complete combustion
        - $CH_4 + 2O_2$ --> $CO_2 + H_2O + heat$
          - Occurs with a sufficient supply of oxygen.
          - Carbon dioxide is produced.
     2. Incomplete combustion
        - $CH_4 + O_2$ --> $CO + H_2O + heat$
          - Occurs with an insufficient supply of oxygen.
          - Carbonx monoxide is produced (poisonous).
c) Substitution reactions
   - This reaction (chlorination of methane) takes place in UV radiation. For e.g., Methane + Chloride (4 steps):
     1. $CH_4 + Cl_2$  $\frac{UV}{-->}$  $HCl + CH_3Cl$ (monochloro methane)
     2. $CH_3Cl + Cl_2$  $\frac{UV}{-->}$  $HCl + CH_2Cl_2$ (dichloro methane)
     3. $CH_2Cl_2 + Cl_2$  $\frac{UV}{-->}$  $HCl + CHCl_3$ (trichloro methane)
     4. $CHCl_3 + Cl_2$  $\frac{UV}{-->}$  $HCl + CCl_4$ (tetrachloro methane)

| Propene | $C_3H_6$          |
| Butene  | $C_4H_8$          |
| ...     | ...               |
**** Molecular structure of Alkenes
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons, meaning there is one double carbon-carbon bond (C=C).
**** Addition reactions of Alkenes
Alkenes are reactive hydrocarbons.
a) Hydrogenation
   - The addition of hydrogen to an unsatured hydrocarbon is known as hydrogenation. For e.g., Ethene + Hydrogen:
     - $Ethene + H_2$ --> $Ethane$ ($C_2H_4 + H_2$ --> $C_2H_6$).
     Hydrogenation turns an Alkene into an Alkane.
   - Prerequisites for hydrogenation
     1. Catalyst (nickel)
     2. Temperature (200°C)
b) Bromination
   - The passing of bromine water (liquid bromine)(reddish-brown) through hydrocarbons for the purpose of identification. For e.g., Bromine water + Ethene:
     - $C_2H_4 + Br_2$ --> $C_2H_4Br$ (Dibromo Ethane)
       - The colour transitions from reddish-brown --> colourless.
   - When a hydrocarbon becomes colourless after reacting with bromine water, it means it is unsaturated.
c) Hydration
   - Alkenes can react with steam to produce an alcohol. For e.g., Ethene + Water: $C_2H_4 + H_2O (g)$ --> $C_2H_4OH$ (Ethanol)
   - Prerequisites for hydration
     1. Catalyst (Phosphoric Acid ($H_3PO_4$))
     2. Temperature (300°C)
     3. Pressure (60°C)
d) Polymerization
   - Alkenes make long-chain molecules at high temperature + presure. For e.g., polymerization of ethene:
     - Ethene $\frac{high\ temperature + high\ pressure}{-->} Polythene/Poly-ethene$
     - $n(CH=CH)$ $\frac{polymerization}{-->}$ $(-CH_2-CH_2-)_n$ (monomer --> polymer)
   - A monomer is a small unit of a polymer that is repeated multiple times.
   - A polymer is a long-chain molecule.
**** Preparation of Alkenes via cracking of Alkanes
Alkanes are cracked in order to prepare an Alkene + other products:
- $Long-chain\ Alkane$ $\frac{cracking}{-->}$ $[mixture\ of\ short-chain\ Alkenes] + [mixture\ of\ short-chain\ Alkanes\ OR\ Hydrogen]$
For e.g.,
- $C_{18}H_{38}$ $\frac{cracking}{-->}$ $C_{10}H_{20} + C_8H_{16} + H_2$

**** Production of Ethanol
***** Hydration
Refer to [[Addition reactions of Alkenes]]
***** Fermentation
Fermentation is a process in which micro-organisms (i.e. yeast) act on carbohydrates (i.e. glucose) in the *absence of oxygen* to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.
****** Process of fermentation
1. A solution of glucose is mixed with yeast and kept at 37°C.
2. During fermentation, carbon dioxide is produced. Hence, frothing can be observed. Limewater can be used to test the presence of carbon dioxide.
3. A dilute solution of ethanol is produced, at about 15% concentration.
   - This happens because an alcohol content over ~15% kills the yeast and stops the process of fermentation.
   - The diluted solution can be purified to obtain a higher ethanol concentration via fractional distillation.
****** Precautions
| Precaution                                                                            | Reason                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Temperature should be kept at ~37°C                                                   | The enzymes in the yeast work best at this temperature. Any higher then the enzymes will be denatured and fermentation shall stop |
| The apparatus should be kept airtight; no oxygen should interfere during fermentation | Alcohol + oxygen --> Carboxylic acid + water                                                                                      |

** Fractional distillation of petroleum
Petroleum is a naturally-occuring liquid mixture of hydrocarbons, that is dark-brown in colour, has a high viscosity and is foul-smelling. In its unrefined form, petroleum is known as crude oil. In order for it to be used, it has to be refined first. This refining is done via fractional distillation.
*** Process
1. In its raw form, petroleum is heated and vapourised.
2. The vapours are passed into the fractionating column.
3. The vapours rise up the fractionating column. The fractionating column is made up of a series of shelfs of varying temperatures. The lower shelves have a high temperature, the higher shelves have a lower temperature. When the vapours meet a shelf that is lower in temperature than its boiling point, it condenses and is collected.
*** Fractions
A total of 7 fractions are collected from this process:
1. Petroleum gas
2. Gasoline
3. Naptha
4. Kerosene
5. Diesel
6. Lubricating oil
7. Bitumen

** Nature of electrodes
The material of the electrode can yield different results. A reactive electrode may partake in the process of electrolysis, while an unreactive electrode does not.
** Reaction at anode and cathode
*** Anode
Oxidation occurs at the anode.
*** Cathode
Reduction occurs at the cathode.
** Changes in electrolyte
Possible changes to an electrolyte after electrolysis include:
1. Concentration
   - The concentration of solute in the electrolyte may change after electrolysis has occurred. Take the electrolysis of Sodium Chloride (aq):
     1. Ions
        - \(Na^+, Cl^-, H^+, OH^-\)
     2. Reaction at anode
        - \(4OH^- --> 4e^- (aq) + H_2O (l) + O_2 (g)\)
     3. Reaction at cathode
        - \(2H^+ + 2e^- --> H_2 (g)\)
     4. Change in electrolyte
        - Since hydrogen and water are released in the form of gas, the elements left in the electrolyte are sodium chloride and an amount of water, less than before. This means the concentration of sodium chloride has increased after electrolysis.
2. Colour
   - The colour of an electrolyte may change after electrolysis. In the case of copper sulfate, for example, the electrolyte turns from blue to colourless.
3. Acidity
   - If a compound with hydrogen forms, i.e. \(HCl\) or \(H_2SO_4\), the electrolyte has turned acidic.
4. Alkalinity
   - If a compound with hydroxide forms, i.e. \(NaOH\) or \(KOH\), the electrolyte has turned alkaline.

* Metals
** Extraction of metals
**** Ores
An ore is a mineral that contains a sufficient quantity of metal(s) that can be easily extracted.
*** Extraction
***** Reactive metals
Reactive metals are separated via electrolysis. For e.g.,
- \(Al_2O_3 --> Al^{3_}+O^{2-}\)
***** Unreactive metals
Unreactive metals are separated via reduction. For e.g.,
- \(PbO + C \frac{heat}{-->} Pb + CO\)
- \(ZnO + C \frac{heat}{-->} Zn + CO\)

4. Type of reaction (exothermic/endothermic)
5. Removal of impurities (slag formation)
6. Extraction of iron
* Air, water and gases
** Treatment of water
*** Filtration
Water is pumped out through filters to trap any large particles.
**** Natural filtration
Water is passed through a bed of sand (which is insoluble in water), acting as a natural filter.
*** Coagulation
A coagulant (i.e. \(Fe_2(SO_4)_3\) (Iron(III) sulfate)) is added to the water to make small, suspended particles stick together. Air is then blown through the water to make the coagulated particles rise to the top of the water in the form of froth/foam.
*** Purification
**** Charcoal
Charcoal can be used to remove the taste and smell of water.
**** Chlorination
Chlorine is added to kill the bacteria and some other microbes in the water.
** Fertilizers
Most fertilizers are made from:
1. nitrogen (for the chlorophyll and protein of plants)
2. phosphorous (for the roots of a plant and the ripening of fruits)
3. potassium (for the protein of plants)
** Ammonia
*** Industrial preparation of Ammonia (\(NH_3\))
**** Raw materials
In order to make ammonia on an industrial scale, the following is needed:
1. Hydrogen
   - Obtained via:
     a) cracking of alkanes
     b) reacting methane with steam
2. Nitrogen
   - Obtained via:
     a) fractional distillation of air
*** Haber's process
**** Chemical reaction
- \(N_2+3H_2 \frac{Fe, 200atm, 450°C}{<-->}2NH_3\) (reversible)
***** Conditions
1. 450°C (temperature)
2. 200atm (pressure)
3. Iron (catalyst)
