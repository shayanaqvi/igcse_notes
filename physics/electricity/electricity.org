* Charges
The charge of a particle affects its properties.
- Like charges (positive <-> positive, negative <-> negative) repel.
- Opposite charges (positive <-> negative) attract.
- Neutral charges attract with positive/negative charges.
  - Neutrons carry both positive and negative charges; if it comes with close proximity with a charged object, the corresponding charges in the neutron will attract and repel.
* Electric fields
A region or space around a unit positive charge where it experiences an electrostatic force is known as an electric field.

- The proximity of the field lines of an electric field determine how strong the field is. The closer the proximity, the stronger the field; the farther the proximity, the weaker the field.
